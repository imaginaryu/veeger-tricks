A/V tricks in javascript

I'm a graphics/audio/film guy who has worked for three years on Magento front-end customizations and product installations, and has reconfigured 6-7 magento stores, but needs to learn more about PHP and back-end customization.

I've also produced, with the help of talented jscript programmers, a fortune-telling website, and some other game
sites. I'm looking to learn more about javascript and merge it with my extensive multimedia experience.

I own about 30 quality domains that I'm trying to develop into traffic-generating sites. Coders, and marketing
people, get on board if you like! Let's talk!
